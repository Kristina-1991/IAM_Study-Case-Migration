# Executive Summary 

This study case presents the end-to-end transformation of Identity and Access Management (IAM) capabilities for a European energy and utilities provider facing major operational and compliance challenges related to identity lifecycle management, 
access approvals, recertification processes, and fragmented legacy systems.

The initiative is delivered by a three-member consulting team:

- **IAM Architect** – Defines strategic direction and ensures alignment with Zero Trust and regulatory expectations.

- **IAM Solution Architect** – Designs technical integration patterns, cloud identity foundations, and federation models.

- **IAM Business Analyst (author)** – Leads requirements discovery, risk-based gap analysis, governance modelling, and alignment of business needs with technical delivery.

The project aims to deliver measurable business value by:

- **Migrating core IAM capabilities to Microsoft Entra ID** to modernize authentication, lifecycle automation, and policy-based access control.

- **Reducing operational risk** by addressing process fragmentation, inconsistent controls, and audit findings impacting compliance (GDPR, ISO 27001, NIS2).

- **Improving efficiency** through automated joiner-mover-leaver processes, reduced manual interventions, and unified identity governance.

- **Establishing a sustainable governance model** supported by clear SLAs, ownership definitions, and an IAM Center of Excellence.

- **Formalizing a Shared Responsibility Model** to clarify strategic, operational, and technical IAM responsibilities across security, IT, and business roles.

- **Driving organizational adoption** through structured change management, stakeholder engagement, and communication planning.

This portfolio consolidates the project deliverables across all phases—analysis, design, implementation readiness, 
and governance—demonstrating how IAM strategy, risk assessment, and cloud-based identity architecture are applied in a real consulting context.

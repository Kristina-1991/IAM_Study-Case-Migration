# Portfolio Introduction
## Purpose

This portfolio illustrates how an IAM Consultant (Business Analysis & Strategy) leads a critical infrastructure organization through a full IAM transformation—from fragmented legacy systems to a modern, cloud-based Microsoft Entra ID and Entra ID Governance platform.
It demonstrates structured consulting work, business-driven analysis, and risk-aligned design decisions typical of Big4 IAM engagements.

## Context

The project is framed as a strategic migration for a European energy and utilities provider operating under increasing regulatory pressure (GDPR, ISO 27001, NIS2).
The organization faces challenges commonly seen in large enterprises:

- manual and error-prone provisioning,
- inconsistent access request and approval processes,
- limited visibility during access reviews and certifications,
- fragmented ownership across business and IT,
- outdated IAM components coexisting with modern requirements.

To reflect a realistic IAM landscape, the scenario includes both legacy systems and cloud identity capabilities.
The project is presented through a scenario-based consulting approach, demonstrating how issues are identified, analysed, and translated into sustainable IAM improvements.

## Project structure 

The portfolio follows a structured consulting methodology delivered through five project phases:

1. Phase 1 : Analysis & Current-state Assessment
2. Phase 2 : Future-state Design & Validation
3. Phase 3 : Implementation readiness
4. Phase 4 : Go-live preparation & risk controls
5. Phase 5 : Handover, Governance & continuous improvement

Each phase includes the expected deliverables, governance checkpoints, and risk-based prioritization activities.


## Consultant positioning

- SLA, KPI and operational process definition
- Risk register, incident response playbooks, and auditability controls

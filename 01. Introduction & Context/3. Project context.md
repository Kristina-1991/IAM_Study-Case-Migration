# Project Context

## 1. project context 
The Utilities organization is undergoing a broad digital modernization initiative across both IT and OT environments. As part of this effort, Identity & Access Management (IAM) has been identified as a critical enabler for security, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance.

The current IAM landscape is highly fragmented, relying on:

- Multiple uncoordinated directories (AD forests, local account stores, application-embedded identities)
- Manual and inconsistent Joiner–Mover–Leaver processes
- Limited automation and no authoritative source of identity truth
- Undefined ownership split across HR, IT, Security, and operations
- Lack of measurable service levels (SLAs) and recurring access incidents

These issues generate : 

- Elevated security risks (excess privileges, orphan accounts, dormant access)
- Operational delays (slow provisioning, inconsistent offboarding)
- Compliance gaps, particularly in auditability and access governance
- Loss of trust from business stakeholders relying on timely and secure access

To address these challenges, the client initiated a transformation program to migrate from legacy IAM components to a cloud-based, Zero-Trust aligned IAM model leveraging:

- Microsoft Entra ID as the cloud identity foundation
- Microsoft Entra ID Governance for modern access governance
- Automation of lifecycle processes
- Harmonized IAM controls across IT and OT ecosystems

The project serves both strategic and operational objectives: 

- strengthening security,
- simplifying identity operations,
- improving user experience,
- and establishing robust, long-term IAM governance.

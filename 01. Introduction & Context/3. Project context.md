# Project Context, Objectives & Scope

## 1. Context 
The client’s IT department has launched a strategic transformation to modernize its Identity & Access Management (IAM) landscape.
The existing environment is characterized by:

- Fragmented directories and lack of unified identity sources
- Manual provisioning and deprovisioning, causing delays and errors
- Unclear ownership across IT, security, and operational teams
- Absence of defined SLAs, resulting in service inconsistency
- Erosion of stakeholder trust due to recurring identity-related incidents

To address these issues, the organization is migrating IAM services to Microsoft Entra ID, enabling:

- Centralized identity management across IT and OT
- Enforcement of Zero Trust principles (least privilege, continuous verification)
- Elimination of legacy dependencies
- Establishment of a scalable IAM governance model

## 2. Objectives 

The transformation program aims to deliver the following strategic, operational, and governance outcomes:

### Security & Architecture 

- Modernize IAM by adopting Microsoft Entra ID and enforcing Zero Trust principles (least privilege, authentication hardening, continuous monitoring).
- Harmonize IAM processes across hybrid IT/OT landscapes.

### Operational excellence 

- Automate identity lifecycle management (Joiner–Mover–Leaver) for employees, contractors, and partners.
- Introduce clear and measurable SLAs:
   - **Provisioning:** <24h
   - **Offboarding :** <1h
   - **Incident response:** <4h 
   
### Governance & risk management 

- Establish an IAM Center of Excellence (CoE) to centralize ownership, processes, and decision-making.
- Deploy a Shared Responsibility Model for cloud IAM governance (organization ↔ cloud provider).
- Strengthen compliance posture with formalized IAM policies, procedures, and access reviews.

### Change management & adoption 

- Implement structured change management activities to enhance adoption and clarify roles, responsibilities, and expected behaviors.

## In scope

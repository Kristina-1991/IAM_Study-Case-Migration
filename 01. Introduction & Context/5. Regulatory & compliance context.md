# Regulatory & Compliance Context 

The IAM modernization program must comply with a set of European, international, 
and industry-specific regulations relevant to critical infrastructure and the energy sector. 
These requirements shape the design of the target IAM architecture and governance model.

## Key regulatory and standards framework 

- **NIS2 Directive (EU):** Reinforces cybersecurity obligations for Operators of Essential Services,
including incident response, identity governance, and access control for critical infrastructure.
- **ISO/IEC 27001:** Defines mandatory security controls for an Information Security Management System (ISMS), including identity lifecycle management,
authentication, and access rights governance.
- **ISO 50001:** Ensures secure and efficient management of energy operations; relevant for safeguarding access to energy management systems.
- **ISO 19443:** Applies to organizations involved in nuclear activities; requires strict control of personnel access and supplier assurance.
- **IEC Smart energy cybersecurity guidelines**  Provides controls for securing smart grids, SCADA, and distributed energy resources across OT environments.
- **GDPR:** Imposes requirements on the protection, minimization, and lawful processing of personal data linked to workforce identities.
- **ENISA Energy sector cybersecurity guiance:** Offers best practices for identity, authentication, and access to critical energy systems and operational assets.

## Compliance alignment through IAM transformation

The target IAM strategy and Entra ID architecture support compliance by:

- Enforcing strong authentication through MFA, Conditional Access, and risk-based policies.
- Implementing least-privilege access, role-based access control (RBAC), and periodic access reviews via Entra ID Governance.
- Establishing a centralized IAM governance model, with documented roles, responsibilities, and risk ownership.
- Providing audit-ready reporting on identity lifecycle events, privileged access, and policy enforcement.
- Ensuring traceability and accountability for user access to both IT and OT systems.

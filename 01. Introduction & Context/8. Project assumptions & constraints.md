## Project Assumptions & Constraints

### **Assumptions**
The following assumptions underpin the successful delivery of the IAM migration program:

1. **Authoritative Source:**  
   The HR system is the single source of truth for workforce, contractor, and partner identities. Data synchronization processes are reliable, validated regularly, and provide accurate joiner, mover, and leaver information.

2. **Cloud Availability:**  
   Microsoft Entra ID services—including Entra ID, Entra ID Governance, and Sentinel—are fully licensed, available, and tested for compatibility with existing hybrid infrastructure (Active Directory, Workday, and enterprise applications).

3. **Executive Sponsorship:**  
   Sustained support from the CISO and CIO ensures program prioritization, rapid decision-making, and secured funding throughout the project lifecycle.

4. **Phased Migration Approach:**  
   Migration from on-premises Active Directory to Entra ID will be executed progressively by business unit, enabling coexistence with legacy systems and minimizing operational disruption.

5. **Stakeholder Engagement:**  
   Business units, IT operations, and security teams are expected to actively participate in workshops, reviews, and validations to ensure solution alignment with business and security requirements.

6. **Change Management Capacity:**  
   Adequate training, communication, and organizational resources are allocated to support adoption of new processes and technologies.

7. **Shared Responsibility Model:**  
   Clear, documented, and agreed roles and responsibilities between the cloud provider and the organization are established prior to migration.

8. **Modern Security Adoption:**  
   The organization commits to implementing modern authentication standards (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, FIDO2) and embedding Zero Trust principles across the IAM environment.

9. **IAM Team Capacity:**  
   The internal IAM team possesses—or will acquire—the required skills and availability to implement lifecycle automation, manage the IAM Center of Excellence, and sustain long-term operations.

10. **Risk Mitigation:**  
    Risks associated with legacy system complexity, overprivileged access, and organizational change resistance will be proactively monitored, addressed through mitigation plans, and reviewed regularly.

> **Note:** These assumptions provide a foundation for risk-informed planning, design, and phased implementation of the IAM program.

### **Constraints**
The IAM migration program operates under several constraints that influence scope, timeline, and resource allocation:

1. **Legacy System Complexity:**  
   The coexistence of multiple on-premises Active Directory forests and fragmented IAM tools may limit automation and require phased integration.

2. **Regulatory Compliance:**  
   The project must comply with NIS2, GDPR, ISO 27001, ISO 50001, and IEC Smart Energy Cybersecurity guidelines, restricting certain shortcuts or rapid deployment options.

3. **Resource Availability:**  
   Limited internal IAM team capacity, combined with competing IT projects, may constrain project timelines.

4. **Operational Dependency:**  
   Migration activities must avoid disruption to critical IT and OT systems, limiting downtime windows and requiring careful cutover planning.

5. **Technology Limitations:**  
   Legacy applications may have limited support for modern authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0, SAML, FIDO2), requiring workarounds or additional integration effort.

6. **Stakeholder Alignment:**  
   Cross-functional approvals and decision-making cycles may slow project delivery, particularly where roles and responsibilities are not fully matured.

7. **Budget & Licensing:**  
   Cloud licensing and tool acquisition must remain within the approved budget, constraining solution design options or scope extensions.

> **Note:** These constraints are actively monitored in risk registers and mitigated through phased implementation, governance oversight, and continuous stakeholder engagement.

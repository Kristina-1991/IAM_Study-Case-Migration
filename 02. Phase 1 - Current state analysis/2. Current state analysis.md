# 2. Current state analysis 

## 2. & IAM Landscape Overview 

The current IAM landscape consists of a hybrid environment combining on-premise directories (Active Directory), several business applications, and emerging cloud services. Identity-related processes are partially automated, relying on manual interventions for key steps such as access approval and periodic reviews. No centralized governance framework exists, and IAM capabilities are distributed across multiple teams (IT operations, HR, Security, business units).

### Key observations: 

- Multiple identity sources (AD, HRIS, contractor spreadsheet) with weak synchronization.
- Access management differs across systems (local accounts, AD groups, application roles).
- Limited standardisation of role models and entitlement structures.
- Lack of visibility across applications regarding who has access to what.

### Initial risk indicators: 
- Risk of excessive access accumulation due to limited lifecycle automation.
- Inconsistent enforcement of access approval policies.
- Weak governance structure leading to unclear responsibilities.

## 2.2 Identity Lifecycle assessment 

Identity lifecycle processes are partially defined but inconsistently implemented. HR acts as the primary identity source, but data accuracy and completeness vary. Technical onboarding and offboarding rely on manual triggers handled by IT.

### Onboarding 

- Delays in account provisioning due to manual steps.
- Absence of standardized access profiles for roles or job functions.Absence of standardized access profiles for roles or job functions.
- Local accounts created directly in applications for contractors.

### Modification (Moves): 

- No systematic process for updating access after internal moves.
- Access accumulation patterns observed, particularly for long-term employees.

### Offboarding: 

- No automated offboarding workflow.
- Contractor offboarding handled manually with no consistent follow-up.
- Inconsistent evidence for access removal across systems. 

**Overall maturity:** Low to medium, with high dependency on human intervention and weak traceability. 

## 2.3 Access request & approvals assessment 

Access is currently requested via email, ticketing tools, or informal communication depending on the system. Approval chains vary significantly and are not consistently documented.

**Findings:**

- No centralized access request portal.
- No standardized catalog of access rights or application roles.
- Approval workflows not aligned with risk levels (e.g, elevated roles approved by non-managers).
- Long delays due to repeated back-and-forth and lack of transparancy.

**Impact:**

- High operational workload for IT teams.
- Increased risk of incorrect access assignments.
- Lack of auditability and compliance evidence.

## 2.4 Access reviews & certifications assessment 

Periodic access reviews are conducted irregularly and vary in depth across departments. Application owners perform manual reviews using spreadsheets extracted from AD or applications.

**Current approach:**

- Reviews performed once a year for a limited set of critical applications.
- Lack of structured methodology or standard review templates.
- No systematic review of shared accounts, privileged accounts, or admin groups.
- Reviewers often lack context to validate entitlements.

**Observed issues:**

- Certifications completed only for audit requirements, not for ongoing governance.
- Evidence quality is inconsistent and difficult to trace.
- No detection or remediation plan for toxic combinations or SoD violations.

## 2.5 Governance, Risk & Compliance findings 

There is no formal IAM governance framework, and IAM processes lack assigned owners. Compliance obligations (ISO 27001, NIS2, internal policies) are only partially addressed through the current IAM setup.

**Governance gaps:**

- No IAM RACI, unclear ownership for lifecycle steps.
- Security teams involved late or reactively.
- Lack of a centralized policy for identity and access governance.

**Risk & compliance findings:**

- Non-compliance with least-privilege principles due to access accumulation.
- Inability to demonstrate proof of access approvals for many applications.
- No standard SoD framework; risks not documented.
- Gaps in evidence retention for audits.

**Overall conclusion:**
IAM governance maturity is low, exposing the organization to operational inefficiencies, audit findings, and elevated security risks.

## Current State Assessment & IT Challenges

### 1. Overview
The current state assessment identifies key issues within the organization’s IAM ecosystem. Understanding these challenges provides a baseline to guide transformation and migration to Microsoft Entra ID with Zero Trust principles.

### 2. Problems Identified

#### 2.1 Identity Lifecycle Management
- Onboarding delays of 10–14 days; accounts provisioned manually via IT tickets.
- Offboarding delays create orphan accounts, increasing security risks.
- Joiner/Mover/Leaver workflows are not automated or integrated with HR systems.

#### 2.2 Access Requests & Approvals
- Email-based approvals with no audit trails; no self-service portal.
- Business units lack visibility on request status, creating compliance gaps.

#### 2.3 Access Reviews & Certifications
- Manual, spreadsheet-based reviews covering only critical systems.
- Incomplete processes fail GDPR and NIS2 compliance requirements.

#### 2.4 Technical Limitations
- Legacy on-premises IAM platform with limited connectors, no API-first design.
- OT identities (SCADA) unmanaged; outdated authentication methods increase risk.

#### 2.5 Governance & Ownership
- IAM responsibilities fragmented across IT and Security.
- No SLAs; governance is reactive, informal, and lacks steering committee oversight.

#### 2.6 Risk & Compliance
- Proliferation of orphan accounts and weak traceability.
- Shadow IT usage, weak access controls, and incomplete audit readiness.

#### 2.7 User Experience
- Multiple credentials, no SSO; low adoption of IAM tools due to inefficiency.

### 3. Methodology

#### 3.1 Data Gathering
- Stakeholder interviews (IT, Security, HR) for qualitative insights.
- Documentation review: pentest reports, audits, IAM procedures.
- Field observations to validate workflows and identify gaps.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Current State Assessment Report:** narrative of findings, risks, and operational challenges.
2. **Checklist:** structured control-based assessment to identify gaps and support audit compliance.

### 4. Current State Assessment Report

**Key Observations**
- Fragmented IAM ecosystem, manual processes, high risk exposure.
- Regulatory compliance gaps (GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001).
- Strong need for modernization, automation, and governance clarity.

**Checklist Highlights**

| Control/Requirement | Status | Notes |
|--------------------|--------|-------|
| Clear RBAC policies | No | Access requests processed individually; no central policy |
| Automated Joiner/Mover/Leaver | No | Manual, fragmented; delays and orphan accounts |
| MFA enforcement | No | Weak authentication controls |
| Self-service access portal | No | Users rely on IT support |
| Periodic access reviews | No | Ad-hoc, incomplete, non-compliant |
| Logging & audit trails | No | Inconsistent; limited auditability |
| Governance framework | No | Fragmented responsibilities; no steering committee |
| SSO / federated access | No | Multiple credentials, poor UX |
| Monitoring & anomaly detection | No | Limited detection of suspicious activity |
| Regulatory compliance | No | GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001 gaps |
| Non-human identities | No | IoT, machine, API accounts unmanaged |
| Adaptive/passwordless authentication | No | Mainly password-based, weak security |

### 6. SWOT Analysis

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------------|
| Internal IAM expertise | Manual provisioning, errors |
| Awareness of compliance needs | No automation or governance |
| Dedicated IAM team | Limited MFA/SSO deployment |

| Opportunities | Threats |
|---------------|---------|
| Automation & Zero Trust adoption | Human error, regulatory non-compliance |
| SaaS integration & self-service | Shadow IT, cyberattacks |
| IAM governance improvements | Data breaches, reputation risk |

### 7. Mapping of Systems & Responsibilities

| System/Application | Process | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|------------------|--------|------------|------------|-----------|---------|
| HR System (Workday) | Onboarding | HR Manager | HR Director | IAM BA, IT Ops | Business Units |
| IAM Platform | Lifecycle Mgmt | IAM Admin | IAM Manager | Security Officer | Compliance Officer |
| Access Request System | Approvals | Service Desk | IT Service Manager | Business Process Owners | End Users |
| SOC/SIEM | Incident Response | SOC | CSO | IAM Manager | IT, Business Units |
| Collaboration Tools | External Access | IT Security Team | IT Manager | Compliance | Partners |
| SCADA/OT | IoT/OT | OT Admin | OT Manager | IAM Admin | Security Team |
| Self-Service Portal | UX | IAM Helpdesk | IAM Manager | End Users | IT Support |

---

### 8. IT Challenges

| Challenge | Description | Impact | Suggested Action |
|----------|------------|--------|----------------|
| Manual provisioning | Tickets & scripts | Delays, errors, orphan accounts | Automate workflows, integrate HR |
| Legacy integration | Hard to connect apps | Slow deployment, inconsistent access | Use API-first platforms, standard connectors |
| Fragmented governance | Split responsibilities | Policy inconsistency, slow decisions | Establish governance board |
| User adoption | Complex UI | Low self-service adoption | Improve UX, SSO portals |
| Incomplete reviews | Manual, irregular | Excess privileges, compliance risk | Automate certifications |
| Weak security controls | Limited MFA/Zero Trust | Credential theft | Enforce MFA, adaptive auth |
| Monitoring gaps | No anomaly detection | Late threat response | SIEM, logging, monitoring |

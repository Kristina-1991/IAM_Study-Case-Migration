# 5. Gap analysis 

A structured comparison between Current State, Business Requirements, and Target Capabilities reveals the following gaps:

| **Capability Area**  | **Current State**         | **Target State**                      | **Gap** | **Impact**                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Identity Lifecycle   | Semi-manual, inconsistent | Fully automated JML                   | High    | Security & compliance exposure |
| Access Request       | Email/ticket-driven       | Centralized portal                    | High    | Operational inefficiencies     |
| Access Governance    | Siloed & manual           | Centralized IGA (roles, SoD, reviews) | High    | Audit risks                    |
| Privileged Access    | Shared / unmanaged        | Structured PAM                        | High    | High-risk vulnerability        |
| Authentication       | Legacy mechanisms         | Modern standards (OAuth, OIDC, FIDO2) | Medium  | UX & security fragmentation    |
| Logging & Monitoring | Partial                   | Integrated with SIEM                  | Medium  | Limited detection capability   |
| App Onboarding       | Ad-hoc                    | Standardized onboarding framework     | Medium  | Slow scalability               |

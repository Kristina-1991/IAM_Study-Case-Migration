## Meeting #1: Launch of Phase 1

### Purpose of the Meeting
The primary objective of this initial governance meeting was to:

- Establish a shared understanding of the current IAM context, including pain points, audit findings, incident trends, and business process observations.
- Align all stakeholders on the baseline environment and challenges to avoid premature assumptions or biases.
- Set the stage for a structured Current State Assessment and subsequent analysis required for migration planning.

This meeting ensured that the project team and client representatives had a **common vision of the existing environment**, enabling rigorous and evidence-based analysis in the following phase.

### Key Discussion Points
- Current IAM limitations were highlighted, including **legacy systems, fragmented directories, manual provisioning, unclear ownership, and missing SLAs**, resulting in operational inefficiencies and security risks.  
- The importance of aligning all stakeholders on the reality of the current environment was emphasized to avoid **premature migration assumptions**.  
- Formal **Current State Assessment** was validated as a prerequisite for migration planning.  
- Broad strategic objectives were discussed (modernization, compliance with NIS2, ISO 27001, GDPR) with the understanding that these will be refined post-assessment.  
- Agreement on the need for a **comprehensive Business Requirements Document (BRD)** post-analysis for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### Next Steps
- Finalize the **Current State Assessment** using audits, interviews, and documentation.  
- Prepare detailed documentation on **operational and governance requirements** to feed into the BRD.  
- Plan the **project kickoff meeting**, where strategic migration decisions, roadmap, and formal project documents (Project Charter, BRD) will be presented and validated.  
- Deliver an official presentation of the **migration roadmap and plan**, outlining key phases, milestones, and governance for client approval.

> **Outcome:**  
This initial governance meeting established a solid foundation by converging on current realities, aligning stakeholder expectations, and setting the stage for a successful, structured IAM migration project.

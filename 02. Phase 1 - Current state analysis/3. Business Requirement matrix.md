# 3. Business Requirements Matrix
## 3.1 Overview

Business requirements were collected through stakeholder interviews, security assessments, and process walkthroughs. 
They aim to enhance lifecycle automation, reduce access-related risks, and establish a scalable IAM foundation aligned with regulatory expectations.

# 4. Process & Workflow Analysis
## 4.1 Target Processes Reviewed

- Identity lifecycle (Joiner, Mover, Leaver)
- Access request & approval
- Provisioning / deprovisioning
- Access review & recertification
- Privileged access management
- Application onboarding to IAM

## 4.2 Key findings per process

### 4.2.1 Joiner / Onboarding 

- Manual data handling causing delays and inconsistencies.
- Lack of role-based access bundles.
- Absence of automated triggers from HR.

### 4.2.2 Mover / Internal mobility 

- Access accumulation remains unmanaged.
- No systematic removal of outdated entitlements.
- No structured review during role changes.

### 4.2.3 Leaver / Offboarding 

- Delays of 24–72h for account deactivation.
- No automated deprovisioning across applications.
- High-risk exposure for privileged & contractor accounts.

### 4.2.4 Access requests 

- Missing standardized access catalog.
- Approval flows unclear and inconsistent.
- Significant manual workload for IT support.

### 4.2.5 Access reviews 

- Highly manual (Excel, email).
- Reviewers lack context to validate access.
- Evidence collection incomplete or inconsistent.

# Testing Stratey & UAT plan 

The Testing Strategy & UAT Plan ensures that all IAM components, identity lifecycle, provisioning flows, SSO integrations, Conditional Access, governance workflows, and monitoring, function correctly before go-live.
It validates technical reliability, process alignment, compliance requirements, and user experience.

## 1. Testing objectives 

The testing phase aims to:

- Validate the end-to-end identity lifecycle (JML) from Workday → Entra ID → AD → applications.
- Test access request workflows, approval routing, and provisioning accuracy.
- Validate SSO configurations, authentication flows, and MFA requirements.
- Confirm governance processes such as access reviews and privileged access workflows.
- Ensure monitoring coverage through Sentinel dashboards and alerting rules.
- Provide confidence that the IAM solution is stable, compliant, and ready for production.

## 2. Types of testing 
### 2.1 Unit testing 
- Conducted by technical teams.
- Validates connectors, provisioning rules, attribute mappings, and sync logic.

### 2.2 Integration testing 
Covers all system integrations:

- Workday → Entra ID (HR-driven lifecycle)
- Entra ID ↔ Active Directory (hybrid identity)
- Entra ID Governance workflows
- Application SSO integrations
- Sentinel monitoring and alerting

### 2.3 End-to-end testing 
Simulates real employee lifecycle cases: 
- Joiner creation
- Job change (role, department, manager)
- Internal transfer
- Termination and deprovisioning

### 2.4 Performance & load testing 
- Validate provisioning speed
- Confirm directory sync reliability
- Test scaling behaviors during peak periods (e.g., mass hiring cycles)

### 2.5 Security testing 

- Conditional Access enforcement
- MFA enrollment and fallback
- Privilege escalation risk scenarios
- Sentinel alert validation
- Review of authentication logs and audit traces

## 3. User acceptance testing (UAT)
### 3.1 UAT Scope 
UAT validates the user experience, functional accuracy, and business alignment of:

- Access requests & approvals
- Manager dashboards
- Access review campaigns
- Application SSO flows
- Self-service password reset
- MFA setup and login
- HR-driven lifecycle events

### 3.2 UAT Participants 

- Business users
- Managers / approvers
- Application owners
- HR / HRIS
- IT Operations
- Security team
- IAM CoE

### 3.3 UAT Methodology 

**1. Define use cases & scenarios**

- Technical scenarios (provisioning, SSO)
- Functional scenarios (JML workflows)
- Operational scenarios (approvals, reviews)

**2. Create test scripts**

- Step-by-step instructions
- Expected vs actual results
- Pass / fail criteria

**3. Execute tests**

- Track issues in ITSM/Jira
- Assign severity levels
- Provide immediate feedback loops

**4. Retest & validate fixes***
**5. Formal sign-off from stakeholders**

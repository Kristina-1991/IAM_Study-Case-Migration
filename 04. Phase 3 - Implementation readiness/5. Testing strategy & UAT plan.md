# 3.5 Testing Strategy & User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan

## 1. Purpose  
The Testing Strategy and UAT Plan define the structured approach used to validate the correctness, security, performance, and compliance of the IAM solution prior to production deployment.

This phase ensures that:
- Identity lifecycle events behave as expected  
- Access governance flows operate seamlessly  
- Authentication and SSO functions are reliable  
- Privileged access and non-human identities follow secure patterns  
- Monitoring, logging, and alerts are correctly configured  
- Business stakeholders validate that the solution meets functional needs

Testing is aligned with ISO 27001, GDPR, NIS2, and industry standards for IAM deployments.

## 2. Testing Scope  
Testing activities cover the entire future-state architecture:

### **2.1 Systems in Scope**
- **Workday** (authoritative source)  
- **Microsoft Entra ID** (authentication, provisioning, SSO, Conditional Access)  
- **Active Directory** (hybrid identity, group policies)  
- **Entra ID Governance** (Access Packages, PIM, Access Reviews)  
- **Microsoft Sentinel** (monitoring, identity correlation, alerts)  

### **2.2 Functional Domains**
- Joiner / Mover / Leaver flows  
- SSO access to applications  
- Role-based access models  
- Privileged access workflows (PIM)  
- Access review cycles  
- Security monitoring & SIEM integration  
- Error handling, fallback procedures, and audit trail validation  

---

## 3. Testing Phases

The testing phase is organized into **five layers**, each providing increasing levels of assurance.

---

### **3.1 Unit Testing (UT)**  
Performed by technical teams to validate logical components.

Examples:
- Workday → Entra provisioning rule validation  
- Attribute mappings (e.g., department, manager, role)  
- Conditional Access policies configuration checks  
- AD synchronization and group assignment logic  

**Outcome:** 100% logical rules validated before integration begins.

---

### **3.2 System Integration Testing (SIT)**  
Ensures that components interact correctly across the entire IAM chain.

Focus Areas:
- End-to-end provisioning flows  
- SSO authentication with test applications  
- Identity lifecycle event consistency across systems  
- Non-human identity provisioning workflows  
- AD ↔ Entra hybrid identity synchronization  
- Sentinel ingestion of IAM logs (audit logs, sign-in logs, provisioning logs)  

**Exit Criteria for SIT:**
- All critical flows executed successfully  
- No P1 or P2 defects open  

---

### **3.3 Security & Compliance Testing**  

Includes IAM-specific security validations such as:
- MFA enforcement  
- Conditional Access decision accuracy  
- PIM activation approval workflows  
- Detection of high-risk sign-ins  
- Validation of logging retention requirements  
- Verification of GDPR/NIS2 control coverage  

Sentinel Use Cases:
- Alerts for suspicious sign-ins  
- Alerts on privilege escalation  
- Alerts on orphaned identities  
- Correlation of risky user behavior  

---

### **3.4 Performance & Load Testing**  
Ensures platform stability during peak events.

Scenarios:
- 2,000+ joiners in one Workday batch  
- Thousands of simultaneous SSO authentications  
- High-volume access package requests  
- Log ingestion spikes into Sentinel  

Acceptance Criteria:
- No SLA violation during simulated peak periods  
- Provisioning queues do not exceed target thresholds  

---

### **3.5 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**  
Business stakeholders validate the solution end-to-end.

**UAT Actors:**
- HR (Workday)  
- IT Operations  
- Cybersecurity / GRC  
- Application Owners  
- SOC / Monitoring Teams  

**UAT Scenarios Include:**
- Creating a new employee in Workday → access flows to apps  
- Manager change → automatic updates in Entra & AD  
- Offboarding → instant disable + access removal  
- Access request via Access Package → approval workflow  
- Quarterly access review cycle execution  
- Privileged role activation via PIM  
- Security alert triage in Sentinel  

**UAT Exit Criteria:**
- 95%+ test cases passed  
- All critical defects resolved  
- All stakeholders validated business readiness  
- UAT sign-off by Business + IT + Cybersecurity  

---

## 4. Defect Management Process

### **Severity Levels**
- **P1 – Critical:** IAM outage, authentication failure  
- **P2 – High:** Provisioning disruption, SSO failure for critical apps  
- **P3 – Medium:** Workflow inconsistencies  
- **P4 – Low:** Minor UI or non-blocking issues  

### **Requirements**
- P1 resolved before UAT  
- P2 must be resolved before go-live  
- P3/P4 resolved during Hypercare or v2.0 release  

---

## 5. Required Deliverables  
- Test Strategy Document  
- SIT Plan & Record  
- Security & Compliance Test Report  
- UAT Scenarios & Test Scripts  
- UAT Execution Report  
- Defect & Resolution Log  
- Certification of Go-Live Readiness  

---

## 6. Outcome  
This testing strategy ensures that the IAM solution is:

- Functionally validated  
- Secure against identity threats  
- Compliant with regulatory requirements  
- Operationally stable  
- Approved by business stakeholders  

This establishes strong confidence for the go-live decision and provides a documented assurance trail for internal/external auditors.

# 5. Roadmap & Implementation Plan

## Purpose
This section outlines the phased implementation plan required to transition the organization toward the recommended **Best of Breed Hybrid IAM Architecture**.  
The roadmap provides a structured, risk-controlled path to maturity, ensuring alignment with regulatory expectations, operational priorities, and business continuity constraints typical of the energy and utilities sector.

The implementation plan is divided into **three transformation phases**:  
1) *Stabilize & Standardize*, 2) *Modernize & Integrate*, and 3) *Optimize & Automate*.  
Each phase includes clear objectives, key activities, expected deliverables, and success metrics.

## 5.1 Transformation Phases

### Phase 1 — Stabilize & Standardize (0–6 months)
**Objective:** Establish governance foundations, standardize IAM processes, and reduce operational risk.

**Key Activities**
- Establish the IAM Center of Excellence (CoE) with defined roles, responsibilities, and governance charter.  
- Define and roll out standardized IAM processes (JML, role lifecycle, access request, exception handling).  
- Implement the Shared Responsibility Model across business units and IT teams.  
- Document all human and non-human identities and perform hygiene baseline (dormant accounts, privilege review).  
- Define SLAs/OLAs for IAM services (provisioning, incident response, access changes).  

**Deliverables**
- IAM Governance Framework (policies, standards, processes).  
- Service Catalogue + SLAs.  
- Identity Inventory Report.  
- Target Role Model (initial version).  

**Success Metrics**
- 90% of identities mapped and validated.  
- Provisioning errors reduced by 30%.  
- IAM processes adopted by all business units.

### Phase 2 — Modernize & Integrate (6–18 months)
**Objective:** Implement the hybrid architecture components (Workday → Entra ID → AD), strengthen compliance, and enable centralized access governance.

**Key Activities**
- Integrate Workday as the authoritative HR source of truth for automated provisioning.  
- Deploy Entra ID Governance (Access Reviews, Entitlement Management, Lifecycle Workflows).  
- Harmonize Active Directory and Entra ID identity models to support hybrid authentication.  
- Migrate priority applications to Entra ID (SSO + MFA), based on risk and business criticality.  
- Onboard non-human identities into the governance model with segmentation and PAM integration.  
- Integrate SIEM (Microsoft Sentinel) for identity-related monitoring and continuous threat detection.

**Deliverables**
- Hybrid Identity Architecture (Workday → Entra ID → AD).  
- Centralized Access Governance Platform active.  
- Identity Compliance Dashboard (reviews, orphaned accounts, privileged access).  
- Application Migration Plan + executed waves.  
- Sentinel identity correlation rules + alerting playbooks.

**Success Metrics**
- 80% of critical applications migrated to SSO + MFA.  
- 100% of privileged accounts governed.  
- Automated access reviews for all regulated roles.  
- Reduction of identity-related incidents by 40%.

---

### Phase 3 — Optimize & Automate (18–36 months)
**Objective:** Achieve full IAM maturity through automation, continuous monitoring, and advanced governance capabilities.

**Key Activities**
- Implement lifecycle automation workflows (contractors, partners, temporary roles).  
- Engineer and validate RBAC/ABAC models, including SoD policies and enforcement rules.  
- Expand governance to OT/SCADA environments where technically feasible.  
- Automate recertification processes and integrate with SIEM for risk-based triggers.  
- Implement continuous compliance monitoring aligned with NIS2 / GDPR / internal audit needs.  
- Establish KPIs & reporting dashboards for executive-level visibility.

**Deliverables**
- Fully Automated Identity Lifecycle (human + non-human).  
- RBAC/ABAC Governance Framework.  
- OT/SCADA Access Governance Roadmap.  
- Enterprise IAM KPI Dashboard.  
- Operating Model 2.0 (optimized roles, responsibilities, and processes).

**Success Metrics**
- 95% automation of identity lifecycle events.  
- 100% compliance for critical access certifications.  
- Measurable reduction of IAM operational cost through process automation.  
- IAM maturity level improved to “Managed/Optimized” (based on NIST / ISO 27001).

## 5.2 Strategic Waves & Dependencies

To ensure a controlled implementation, the transformation is delivered in **four strategic waves**:

1. **Wave 1 – Governance First:**  
   IAM CoE, policies, process standardization, non-human identity baseline.

2. **Wave 2 – Foundation & HR Integration:**  
   Workday integration, authoritative source stabilization, AD/Entra identity alignment.

3. **Wave 3 – Application & Privileged Access Modernization:**  
   Entra SSO, MFA, governance activation, onboarding of high-risk applications.

4. **Wave 4 – Automation & Continuous Compliance:**  
   RBAC/ABAC automation, continuous monitoring via Sentinel, compliance dashboards.

**Critical Dependencies:**
- HR data quality and Workday readiness  
- Network/AD hygiene and existing identity conflicts  
- Application owners’ readiness for migration  
- Regulatory deadlines (NIS2, internal audits, market regulators)

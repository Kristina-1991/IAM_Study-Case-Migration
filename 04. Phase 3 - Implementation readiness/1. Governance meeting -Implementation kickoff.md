# 3.1 Governance Meeting – Functional Analysis Kickoff
## Purpose of the Meeting

The objective of this governance meeting is to formally open the Functional Analysis phase and validate the scope, methodology, decision-making rules, and required inputs for progressing from high-level design to detailed functional specifications.
This meeting ensures alignment between Security, IAM Engineering, IT Operations, and the Business Owners before deeper analysis begins.

### Agenda 

1. Recap of validated business requirements (Phase 2)
2. Review of the Target IAM Architecture (high-level)
3. Definition of functional analysis workstreams
4. Identification of dependencies (AD / Entra ID Governance / HRIS / Sentinel / Line Managers)
5. Validation of RACI and meeting cadence
6. Planning next steps

### Key inputs 

- Business Requirements Matrix (BRM) — validated
- Target IAM Architecture (Entra ID / Entra Governance / Active Directory / HR source)
- Integration overview diagram (AD ↔ Entra ID ↔ Entra Governance)
- Security & compliance constraints (NIS2 principles, least privilege, separation of duties)

### Expected ouptuts 
- Confirmed list of functional workstreams:
   - Access lifecycle design (JML)
   - Role & group governance
   - Identity lifecycle data model
   - Access request & approval flows
   - Automated provisioning & deprovisioning
   - Monitoring & detection through Microsoft Sentinel 
- Updated RACI for the analysis phase
- Functional analysis timeline (2-3 weeks)
- Open risks and dependencies log

### Meeting minutes (extract) 

#### 1. Scope Confirmation

All parties confirmed that the functional analysis will strictly cover:

- Standard identities (employees, contractors)
- AD groups and Entra ID access packages
- Lifecycle automation based on HR source-of-truth
- No PAM scope included

Decision: PAM removed to keep the scope aligned with governance maturity and realistic integration for MVP.

#### 2. Architectural alignment 
The architecture validated in phase 2 is confirmed as the backbone for all functional work: 

- Active Directory remains the primary authentication directory for legacy workloads.
- Entra ID is the strategic identity plane for cloud workloads.
- Entra ID Governance is selected to handle lifecycle governance, access reviews, workflows and role-based governance.
- Sentinel is confirmed as the monitoring and detection layer.

Decision: No changes to architecture. Proceed with detailed functional decomposition. 

#### 3. Functional workstreams approved 

The following workstreams are opened: 

| Workstream                                        | Description                                        | Owner               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **WS1. Identity Lifecycle (JML)**                 | HR-driven identity creation, updates & termination | IAM Engineer        |
| **WS2. Role & Group Governance**                  | Standard roles, group policies, naming conventions | Security Officer    |
| **WS3. Access Request Model**                     | Access packages, catalogues, and approval chains   | Product Owner       |
| **WS4. Provisioning / Deprovisioning Automation** | Integration rules AD ↔ Entra ID                    | IAM Engineering     |
| **WS5. Monitoring & Alerting**                    | Onboarding of logs into Sentinel + alert rules     | SOC / Sentinel Lead |

#### 4.  Decisions & risks 
**Decisions** : 
- Entra ID Governance lifecycle workflows prioritized for MVP.
- Automatic deprovisioning is mandatory for all identities based on HR termination events.
- Access reviews will focus initially on AD groups considered "High-Risk Assets".

**Risks identified:**

- HR data quality requires validation before workflow automation.
- No current ownership defined for legacy AD group cleanup.
- Sentinel integration depends on log ingestion capacity.

**Mitigation:**
Workshops shceduled with HR + AD admins, temporary manual ownership assigned for group cleanup. 

### Next steps 
- Launch WS1 - WS5 working sessions.
- Prepare 3.2 Detailed Functional Requirements.
- Complete data mapping from HR → Entra ID → AD.

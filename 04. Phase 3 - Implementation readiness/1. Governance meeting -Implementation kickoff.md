# 3.1 Governance Meeting – Implementation Kickoff

## Purpose of the Meeting
The objective of this kickoff meeting was to officially launch the **Implementation Readiness Phase** following the validation of the solution design baseline.  
This session ensured full alignment across business, IT, security, HR, and executive stakeholders regarding:

- The implementation roadmap  
- Roles and responsibilities  
- Technical and organizational prerequisites  
- Migration strategy and sequencing  
- Risks, constraints, and success conditions  
- Required resources and dependencies  

This meeting marks the transition from *design* to *execution planning*, confirming that the organization is ready to prepare for deployment of the future-state IAM ecosystem.

## Key Discussion Points

### **1. Implementation Roadmap Confirmation**
The team validated the phased deployment approach:
- Phase 1: Foundation (Workday → Entra ID → AD integration, MFA baseline, Conditional Access)  
- Phase 2: Lifecycle automation, group automation, app onboarding core workflows  
- Phase 3: Entra ID Governance (access packages, reviews, separation of duties)  
- Phase 4: Log centralization & monitoring (Sentinel), audit evidence automation  

Stakeholders confirmed that this sequencing aligns with business priorities and resource availability.

---

### **2. Technical Prerequisites Review**
The following items were reviewed and approved:

- Workday SCIM provisioning prerequisites  
- Entra ID hybrid join configuration  
- Attribute mapping for JML events  
- Logging and monitoring pipeline to Sentinel  
- MFA & Conditional Access policy enforcement framework  
- Application inventory finalization (75% completed; remaining 25% planned before Phase 3)  

---

### **3. Data Quality and JML Dependencies**
The HR Director confirmed:
- Two critical data attributes require cleansing before migration  
- Change in job code taxonomy planned for Q3 and must be integrated into role model mapping  
- A dedicated JML validation workshop will be conducted before schema freeze  

---

### **4. Operational Governance Structure**
The meeting validated:
- Updated RACI for identity lifecycle operations  
- SLAs for provisioning/deprovisioning (draft shared, finalization in Phase 3)  
- Shared Responsibility Model between Business, IT Ops, and IAM Team  
- Requirement for weekly cross-functional steering during early implementation  

---

### **5. Change Management & Communication Strategy**
The Change Lead presented:
- Targeted communication plan (executive, BU managers, end users)  
- Training modules for BU access approvers and application owners  
- Adoption KPIs (MFA adoption, SSO usage, access review completion rate)  

The strategy was validated, with emphasis on early communication for high-impact user groups.

---

### **6. Risk Review**
The updated risk register highlighted:
- Data quality dependencies (HR attributes)  
- Onboarding of legacy OT assets (requires technical assessment)  
- Limited availability of SMEs in two business units  
- Risk of timeline slippage for three critical applications pending inventory validation  

Mitigation measures were assigned and approved.

# 3.6 Change Management & Communication Plan

## 1. Purpose  
The Change Management & Communication Plan ensures successful adoption of the future-state IAM solution across the organization.  
It minimizes operational disruption, addresses user impacts, and ensures that identity lifecycle processes, authentication mechanisms, access governance, and monitoring practices are correctly understood and applied.

This plan is aligned with the organizational culture and regulatory constraints (GDPR, NIS2), and leverages structured communication, training, and stakeholder engagement practices.

## 2. Change Management Objectives
The objectives of the change program are to:

- Ensure **business readiness** for new IAM processes and technologies  
- Support users adopting new authentication experiences (SSO, MFA, passwordless)  
- Build awareness about governance models (Access Packages, Access Reviews, RBAC)  
- Train IT and cybersecurity teams on new responsibilities and procedures  
- Reduce resistance by clarifying benefits and removing uncertainty  
- Provide clear communication aligned with the implementation roadmap  
- Guarantee consistent usage of the IAM platform post go-live

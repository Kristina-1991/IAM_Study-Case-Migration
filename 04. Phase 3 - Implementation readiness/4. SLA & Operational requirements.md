# 3.4 SLA & Operational Requirements

## 1. Purpose
This section defines the **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** and **operational requirements** needed to ensure reliable, secure and compliant operation of the IAM ecosystem.  
It formalizes expectations for availability, performance, incident response, monitoring, auditing, and governance across Workday, Entra ID, Active Directory, Entra ID Governance, and Sentinel.

These operational commitments are essential for maintaining IAM maturity aligned with:  
- **NIS2** (security & availability of essential services)  
- **GDPR** (identity accuracy, access restrictions & logging)  
- **ISO 27001** (control framework for identity processes)  

---

## 2. Operating Model Foundations
Operational responsibilities are distributed across three layers:

1. **HR & Business (Workday)** – authoritative identity data  
2. **IT Operations (Entra ID, AD, integrations)** – availability, provisioning, authentication  
3. **Cybersecurity / GRC (Entra Governance, Sentinel)** – monitoring, reviews, compliance  

These responsibilities are further detailed in the RACI (Phase 2 – Section 7).

# 3.4 SLA & Operational Requirements
This section defines the Service Level Agreements (SLAs), operational processes, and support model required to ensure stable, secure, and predictable IAM operations after implementation. These requirements apply to all components of the future-state IAM ecosystem, including Entra ID, Active Directory, Workday integration, Entra ID Governance, and privileged/non-human identity management.

## 1. SLA framework 
The IAM SLA framework is structured around five core dimensions: availability, performance, incident response, request fulfillment, and security. All SLAs must be contractually reinforced with internal IT teams and external vendors.

### 1.1 Availability SLAs 

| Service Component               | SLA Target | Notes                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Entra ID                        | 99.99%     | Provided by Microsoft under cloud SLA |
| Active Directory (On-Prem)      | 99.9%      | Local redundancy required             |
| Workday → Entra ID Provisioning | 99.5%      | Includes HR feed stability            |
| Authentication & SSO Services   | 99.9%      | Applies to all business-critical apps |
| Entra ID Governance             | 99.9%      | Microsoft cloud availability          |

### 1.2 Performance SLAs 

| Process                             | SLA Target | Notes                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Identity provisioning (hire/change) | ≤ 15 min   | End-to-end from HR event            |
| Deprovisioning (termination)        | ≤ 5 min    | Security-critical automatic trigger |
| Role/Group assignment               | ≤ 10 min   | Includes entitlement propagation    |
| Access reviews system availability  | 99.9%      | During audit periods                |

### 1.3 Incident response SLAs

| Priority      | Definition                                    | Response Time | Resolution Target |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| P1 – Critical | Identity outage impacting business continuity | ≤ 15 min      | ≤ 4 hours         |
| P2 – High     | Degraded provisioning, SSO instability        | ≤ 30 min      | ≤ 8 hours         |
| P3 – Medium   | Non-urgent functional incident                | ≤ 4 hours     | ≤ 48 hours        |
| P4 – Low      | Minor functional issues, cosmetic changes     | ≤ 24 hours    | ≤ 5 days          |

### 1.4 Request fulfillment SLAs

| Request Type                         | SLA Target         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| New app onboarding to SSO            | ≤ 10 business days |
| New catalog/role creation            | ≤ 5 business days  |
| Delegated admin access requests      | ≤ 48 hours         |
| Privileged access (PAM) onboarding   | ≤ 5 business days  |
| Non-human identity creation/rotation | ≤ 48 hours         |

## 2. Operational model
The operational model defines how IAM services are run day-to-day, including roles, responsibilities, and support workflows.

### 2.1 IAM Operating roles 

| Role                               | Responsibilities                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IAM CoE (Center of Excellence)** | Governance, roadmap ownership, role model management, access review orchestration  |
| **Identity Operations Team**       | Provisioning, deprovisioning, identity lifecycle monitoring, incident management   |
| **Security Team**                  | Audit monitoring, NIS2 compliance, access review validation, segregation of duties |
| **Application Owners**             | Provide entitlement structure, approve access, maintain application roles          |
| **HRIS Team**                      | Maintain HR data quality, Workday integration stability                            |
| **Infrastructure/AD Team**         | Manage domain controllers, GPOs, hybrid identity health                            |

- Conditional Access baseline policies
- Non-human identities rotated every 30 days
- Least privilege enforced across all roles
- Automated termination workflows preventing orphaned accounts
- Segregation of duties (SoD) checks for high-risk roles

### 3.3 Monitoring & logging

## 5. Technical Design Specifications
### 5.1 Purpose

The purpose of this section is to define the technical specifications required to implement the future-state IAM architecture based on Workday, Microsoft Entra ID, Active Directory, Entra ID Governance, and Microsoft Sentinel.
These specifications translate the functional requirements, governance decisions, and target vision into concrete, actionable technical components that guide implementation, configuration, integration, and security hardening across the IAM ecosystem.

## 5.2 Core Technical Components
### 5.2.1 Identity Source & Data Ingestion (Workday → Entra ID)
Identity Attributes

The integration relies on a structured HR dataset including:

- EmployeeID (unique identifier)
- LegalName and PreferredName
- Email and UPN patterns
- ManagerID
- Department / BusinessUnit
- JobTitle
- EmploymentType (FTE, contractor, partner)
- StartDate / EndDate

### Technical Integration

- Workday to Entra ID provisioning via SCIM API.
- Attribute mapping managed in Entra ID HR-driven provisioning.
- Mandatory validation of data quality (e.g., duplicate IDs, missing managers).
- Pre-hire provisioning enabled (optional) to optimize onboarding.


## 5.3 Identity Lifecycle Technical Specifications
### 5.3.1 Joiner Process

- Automatic creation of Entra ID identity upon HR event.
- Dynamic group assignment based on department, location, job role.
- Initial access package assignment (via Entra ID Governance).

## 5.3.2 Mover Process

- Automatic entitlements reevaluation when HR attributes change.
- Removal of obsolete permissions using Access Reviews or Lifecycle Workflows.
- Manager validation workflow triggered for sensitive access.

## 5.3.3 Leaver Process

- Immediate account disablement upon contract termination.
- 24-hour (configurable) staged deletion with data retention policies.
- Automatic revocation of SSO sessions and MFA tokens.
- Deprovisioning propagates to AD, O365, Salesforce, SQL, and other apps.

## 5.4 Access Management Technical Specifications
### 5.4.1 Single Sign-On (SSO)

- Entra ID as primary Identity Provider (IdP).
- SAML 2.0 and OIDC/OAuth2 used depending on application requirement.
- Passwordless authentication (FIDO2, Windows Hello) for eligible users.

### 5.4.2 Conditional Access

- Policies enforced:
- MFA for all external access.
- Blocking legacy protocols (POP/IMAP, old NTLM).
- High-risk user/session restrictions using Identity Protection signals.
- Conditional Access templates aligned with Zero Trust.

### 5.4.3 Federation with Active Directory

- Hybrid identity supported through Entra Connect Cloud Sync.
- Outbound sync for UPN, group membership, password hash.

## 5.5 Governance & Access Control
### 5.5.1 Entra ID Governance
#### Entitlement Management

- Role-based access packages for common business needs.
- Lifecycle policies (access expiration, manager approval, periodic review).
- Access Reviews
- Quarterly reviews for privileged roles.
- Semi-annual reviews for business application groups.
- Automated remediation for non-responders.

### 5.5.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Definition of technical roles (Global Reader, Security Administrator).
- Entra ID PIM (Privileged Identity Management) for just-in-time elevation.
- Enforced approval + justification required for elevation.


### 5.6 Directory Services (Active Directory)
#### Technical Requirements

- Domain functional level: Windows Server 2016+
- Tiered administration model (Tier 0 / 1 / 2)
- Group policy hygiene: removal of unlinked/obsolete GPOs
- Secure replication (LDAPs enforced)
- Integration with Entra ID
- Cloud Sync for simplified hybrid identity
- Group write-back for specific application dependencies
- Seamless SSO (Kerberos-based)

## 5.7 Logging, Monitoring & SIEM (Sentinel)
### 5.7.1 Log Sources

- Entra ID sign-in logs
- Identity Protection risk events
- Audit logs (group changes, role updates)
- AD domain controller logs
- Application sign-ins (Salesforce, SQL, O365)

### 5.7.2 Use Cases

- Detection of anomalous access patterns
- Impossible travel alerts
- Excessive failed logins
- Privilege escalation tracking
- Orphan account detection (AD vs. Entra ID)

## 5.8 Security Specifications
### Data Protection

- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- Encryption at rest (Microsoft-managed keys)
- Secure API communication (OAuth2 tokens)

### Identity Protection

- Risk-based Conditional Access
- Compromised password detection
- Token theft prevention (token replay protection)

### Passwordless Enablement

- FIDO2
- Microsoft Authenticator app
- Certificate-based authentication (CBA) for legacy systems

## 5.9 Application Integration Specifications
### Office 365

- Full SSO using OIDC
- Conditional Access + session controls
- License automation via dynamic groups

### Salesforce

- SAML integration
- Automatic provisioning/deprovisioning via SCIM
- Mapping to Entra ID security groups

### SQL Applications

- Managed identities preferred for workloads
- Service account governance via Entra Workload Identities

## 5.10 Non-Human Identities (Workload Identities)
### Technical Controls

- Rotate credentials every 90 days
- Use managed identities wherever possible
- Apply least privilege permissions
- Log all service account authentications in Sentinel

## 5.11 Technical Dependencies & Prerequisites

- Workday API access and SCIM configuration
- Entra ID P1/P2 licensing
- Active Directory remediation (OU cleanup, group rationalization)
- Sentinel workspace and data connectors enabled
- Network configuration for hybrid connectivity

## 5.12 Conclusion

This technical design provides the foundation for a secure, scalable, and compliant IAM ecosystem.
It ensures standardized lifecycle automation, modern authentication, governance maturity, and full alignment with regulatory requirements for the energy & utilities sector.

The specifications defined here will directly guide implementation planning, testing, operational readiness, and organizational change management in the upcoming phases.

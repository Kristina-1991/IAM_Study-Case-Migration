# 6. Compliance & Security Controls Mapping  
*(ISO 27001 • NIS2 • GDPR • DORA)*

## Purpose
This section maps the future-state IAM architecture and governance model against key regulatory and security frameworks applicable to the organization.  
The objective is to ensure that the proposed design is fully aligned with mandatory controls, reduces audit findings, and provides a clear traceability matrix between IAM capabilities and regulatory expectations.

The mapping covers the four main frameworks relevant to energy/utilities companies operating in the EU:  
- **ISO 27001 (2022)** – Information Security Management Systems  
- **NIS2 Directive** – Critical infrastructure cybersecurity requirements  
- **GDPR** – Personal data protection and lawful identity processing  
- **DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)** – ICT resilience for regulated entities

## 6.1 Control Mapping Overview

| IAM Capability / Process | ISO 27001 Controls | NIS2 Requirements | GDPR Articles | DORA Areas |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Identity Lifecycle (JML)** | A.6.3, A.5.17 | Art. 21 – Access control | Art. 5(1)(c), 25 | ICT Asset Management |
| **Access Provisioning & RBAC** | A.5.15, A.8.2 | Art. 21 – Policies & controls | Art. 32 | Governance & Control |
| **Privileged Access Governance** | A.8.2.4 | High-risk operator controls | Art. 32 | ICT Risk Management |
| **Access Reviews & Recertifications** | A.5.15, A.5.16 | Art. 21 – Accountability | Art. 5(2) | Operational Integrity |
| **Authentication (MFA/SSO)** | A.8.2.2 | AuthN/Access reinforcements | Art. 32 | ICT Security |
| **Segregation of Duties** | A.6.3, A.8.2.3 | Risk-based access | Art. 25 | Risk Mitigation |
| **Non-Human Identity Governance** | A.5.19 | Supply chain risk | Art. 28 | Third-Party Risk |
| **Logging & Monitoring (Entra + Sentinel)** | A.8.15, A.8.16 | Incident detection | Art. 30, 33 | Detection & Response |

## 6.2 How the Future-State Architecture Meets Regulatory Needs

### **ISO 27001 Compliance**
The proposed Entra ID + AD hybrid architecture ensures:
- Controlled provisioning/deprovisioning aligned with A.5.17  
- Fine-grained access controls via RBAC/ABAC (A.9)  
- MFA-enabled authentication compliant with A.8.2  
- Logging and monitoring through Sentinel addressing A.8.16  

### **NIS2 Alignment**
The future-state IAM design provides:
- Reinforced identity-based security for critical infrastructure  
- Documented access governance policies (mandatory)  
- Evidence-based access reviews for high-risk accounts  
- Continuous monitoring and incident detection (Sentinel)  

### **GDPR Compliance**
IAM controls support:
- Data minimization → role-based access on need-to-know  
- Lawful processing via automated lifecycle management  
- Accountability through certification and audit logs  
- Third-party access transparency  

### **DORA Compliance**
The solution ensures:
- ICT risk management for identities  
- Operational resilience through automated JML flows  
- Enhanced monitoring, alerting, and incident traceability  
- Vendor risk transparency (Workday → Microsoft integrations)

## 6.3 Deliverables
- **Compliance Traceability Matrix** (ISO/NIS2/GDPR/DORA)  
- **IAM Security Control Catalogue**  
- **Audit-Ready Evidence Framework**  
- **Regulatory Gap Remediation Plan**

---

## 6.4 Summary
The proposed future-state architecture provides a **fully compliant, audit-ready identity governance model**, reducing regulatory exposure while supporting operational resilience.

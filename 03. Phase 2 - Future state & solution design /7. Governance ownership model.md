# 7. Governance Ownership Model (RACI)

## Purpose
This section defines the governance ownership model required to operate the future IAM ecosystem.  
The RACI clarifies *who is responsible for what*, reduces friction between business and IT, and establishes a sustainable operational model across the identity lifecycle.

The model is designed around five core IAM functional areas:
1. Identity Lifecycle Management  
2. Access Provisioning & Role Governance  
3. Privileged Access Governance  
4. Access Reviews & Compliance  
5. Monitoring & Incident Response

## 7.1 Governance Principles

- **Clear Accountability:** Each control has a single accountable owner.  
- **Business-driven Access:** Business units own access decisions; IT executes.  
- **Least Privilege by Design:** Role and access models prevent privilege accumulation.  
- **Shared Responsibility Model:** Aligned with NIS2 and ISO expectations.  
- **Auditability:** Every action must be evidence-based and traceable.

# 8. Phase Closure – Validation of Solution Design

## Purpose
The objective of this phase closure is to formally validate the **future-state IAM architecture**, **solution design**, and **governance model** before transitioning to Implementation Readiness (Phase 3).  
This validation ensures full alignment between business, IT, security, compliance, and executive stakeholders and confirms that:

- Requirements from Phase 1 are fully addressed  
- The proposed architecture is feasible, scalable, and compliant  
- The organization approves the selected solution option  
- All dependencies, risks, and assumptions are understood and documented  
- The program can move forward with a clear and approved design baseline  

This milestone is essential to reduce rework, avoid costly design deviations, and ensure audit-ready traceability from requirements → design → implementation.

## 8.1 Validation Approach

### **1. Cross-Stakeholder Review Workshops**
Three review workshops were held with:
- Business Units  
- IT Architecture & Infrastructure  
- CISO Office (Security & Compliance)  
- HR (Workday)  
- Application Owners  

These sessions validated functional and non-functional design components including:
- Architecture patterns  
- Role/RBAC/ABAC model  
- Integration model (Workday → Entra ID → AD → Sentinel)  
- Access review workflows  
- Monitoring and audit evidence requirements  

---

### **2. Requirements Traceability Validation**
A full traceability exercise was completed, linking:

- Phase 1 **Business Requirements Matrix**  
- Phase 2 **Target Architecture**  
- Solution Options & Design Specifications  
- Compliance & Security Controls Mapping  

This ensures every requirement is covered, and non-coverage areas are explicitly documented for transparency.

---

### **3. Risk & Mitigation Review**
Key design-related risks were reviewed and validated including:

- Hybrid dependency (Workday + Microsoft)  
- Integration complexity for legacy OT/SCADA systems  
- Role model robustness  
- Access certification scalability  
- Non-human identity governance  

Mitigation actions were consolidated into the ongoing **IAM Risk Register**.

## 8.2 Sign-Off Summary

| Stakeholder Group | Validation Scope | Approval Status | Notes |
|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Business Units** | Role model, access workflows, approval chains | ✅ Approved | No changes requested |
| **IT IAM Team** | Architecture, integrations, provisioning model | ✅ Approved | Requires detailed mapping for 3 legacy apps |
| **Security (CISO)** | Controls mapping, MFA policy, logging | ✅ Approved | Additional SoD rules to be refined |
| **HR (Workday)** | JML triggers, data attributes | ⚠️ Conditional Approval | Requires cleansing of 2 attributes |
| **Application Owners** | App onboarding approach | ⚠️ Conditional Approval | 5 apps pending inventory validation |
| **Program Steering Committee** | Overall solution design | ✅ Approved | Phase 3 kickoff authorized |

## 8.3 Design Baseline – Final Deliverables

The following documents are now formally baselined:

- **Future State Vision**  
- **Target IAM Architecture (HLA + Detailed)**  
- **Solution Design Specifications**  
- **Solution Options Assessment & Recommendation**  
- **Compliance & Security Controls Mapping**  
- **Governance Ownership Model (RACI + Shared Responsibility)**  
- **Risk Register – Design Phase Update**  
- **Application Onboarding High-Level Plan**

These artifacts form the **contractual baseline** for the next phase and must not be modified without formal change control.

## 8.4 Go/No-Go Decision

**Decision: GO**  
The steering committee validated that the solution design:

- Meets business, security, and compliance expectations  
- Aligns with the organization's hybrid IT/OT reality  
- Is technically feasible using Workday + Entra ID + AD + Entra ID Governance + Sentinel  
- Supports long-term scalability and IAM maturity growth  
- Provides audit-ready documentation for NIS2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and DORA  

The program is now authorized to proceed to **Phase 3 — Implementation Readiness**.

## 8.5 Next Steps (Input for Phase 3)

Immediate preparation steps include:

- Finalizing the *Implementation Roadmap*  
- Establishing the *Data Model & Migration Strategy*  
- Defining *SLAs & operational procedures*  
- Preparing the *Testing Strategy & UAT readiness*  
- Launching the *Change Management & Communications Plan*  
- Validating technical prerequisites (connectors, logs, MFA configuration, etc.)  

This closes the Solution Design Phase.

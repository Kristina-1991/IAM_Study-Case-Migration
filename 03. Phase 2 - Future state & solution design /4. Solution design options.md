# 4. Solution Design Options
## 4.1 Purpose

The purpose of this section is to evaluate the strategic solution options available to modernize the organization’s Identity & Access Management ecosystem.
Each option is assessed through two lenses:

### 1. Transversal IAM initiatives: 
Mandatory components that must be implemented regardless of the chosen technical approach (e.g., IAM processes, IAM CoE, SLAs, Shared Responsibility Model, treatment of non-human identities).

### 2. Migration strategies: 
The variable dimension, defining how the future state will be implemented based on priorities such as cost, compliance requirements, operational complexity, and long-term scalability.

These options provide a decision-making framework enabling the organization to select an approach aligned with regulatory obligations, enterprise architecture constraints, and strategic business needs.

## 4.2 Transversal IAM initiatives (Mandatory accross all options)
| Initiative                          | Description                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Standardized IAM Processes**      | Formalization of JML, access requests, approvals, recertification, and incident workflows.             |
| **IAM Center of Excellence (CoE)**  | Centralized governance with defined ownership and process standardization across business units.       |
| **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** | Provisioning timelines, offboarding deadlines, access request handling, and incident response metrics. |
| **Shared Responsibility Model**     | Clear division of responsibilities between Business, IT, IAM, and Cloud Provider (Microsoft).          |
| **Non-Human Identity Management**   | Governance for service accounts, workload identities, APIs, and application credentials.               |

## 4.3 Solution option evaluation 
### Table: Migration option vs. transversal initiatives

| **Migration Option**                                     | **Transversal Initiatives Applied** | **Advantages**                                                                                                                                                      | **Disadvantages**                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Option 1 – Full Microsoft Stack**                      | All transversal initiatives applied | Native integrations across Entra ID, Governance, and Sentinel; simplified operations; strong Zero Trust alignment                                                   | High vendor dependency; licensing cost                                                   |
| **Option 2 – Hybrid IAM (Microsoft + Additional Tools)** | All transversal initiatives applied | Flexibility for multi-cloud/OT environments; strong governance potential                                                                                            | Increased integration complexity; higher operational overhead                            |
| **Option 3 – Minimal IAM Upgrade**                       | All transversal initiatives applied | Lower cost; quick wins; reduced change impact                                                                                                                       | Limited compliance maturity; no automated access reviews; not fit for a regulated sector |
| **Option 4 – Best of Breed Hybrid (Recommended)**        | All transversal initiatives applied | Optimal alignment with hybrid IT/OT; strong compliance (GDPR, NIS2); Workday + AD + Entra Governance provides end-to-end control; scalable; robust security posture | Higher implementation effort; multi-system dependencies                                  |

# Target IAM Architecture 

## Purpose 

The Target IAM Architecture defines the future technical ecosystem that supports the organization’s identity and access management strategy.
It translates the Future State Vision into a structured, actionable design, covering identity lifecycle, access management, security, and monitoring.

This architecture provides a blueprint for integration, automation, compliance, and governance, ensuring a scalable and secure IAM solution.

## 3.1 High -level architecture 

The high-level architecture illustrates the main components and integrations within the IAM ecosystem:

- **Workday (HR System)**
Authoritative source for all employee, contractor, and contingent workforce identities. 
Provides triggers for joiner, mover, and leaver workflows.

- **Microsoft Entra ID**
Centralized identity provider supporting authentication, SSO, and conditional access. 
Provides unified identity management for cloud and hybrid applications.

- **Microsoft Entra ID Governance**
Manages access reviews, entitlements, and policy enforcement. 
Ensures compliance with GDPR, NIS2, and ISO27001 through automated certifications and reporting.

- **Active Directory (On-premises)**
Supports legacy applications and OT systems. Integrated with Entra ID for hybrid identity management and synchronization.

- **Microsoft Sentinel**
Security information and event management (SIEM) for monitoring, anomaly detection, and incident response across all identity systems.

- **Integration Overview**

## 3.2 Detailed Architecture 
### 3.2.1 Identity Lifecycle management 

- **Joiners:** Automatic account creation in Entra ID and AD based on Workday data. Access assignments follow role-based templates.
- **Movers:** Role and entitlement updates triggered by HR changes, with automated approvals and audit logs.
- **Leavers:** Immediate deactivation and removal of accounts across Entra ID, AD, and integrated applications to eliminate orphan accounts.
- **Non-Human Identities:** Service accounts, applications, and IoT devices managed via Entra ID and Governance policies.

### 3.2.2 Access request & approvals 

- Self-service portal for users to request access.
- Approval workflows routed to business owners and managers.
- All requests logged in Entra ID Governance for auditing.

### 3.2.3 Single Sign-On (SSO) & Conditional access 

- Unified authentication for SaaS and on-premises applications.
- Conditional access based on device, location, risk level, and user type.
- MFA enforced for all privileged and high-risk accounts.

### 3.2.4 Access reviews & recertification 

- Automated review campaigns for all critical systems.
- Business owners validate access, with non-compliance triggering remediation workflows.
- Audit-ready reports generated for GDPR, NIS2, and ISO27001 compliance.

### 3.2.5 Monitoring & security 

- Sentinel ingests logs from Entra ID, AD, and other identity-connected systems.
- Threat detection, anomaly monitoring, and automated alerting to SOC.
- Integration with incident response playbooks to remediate IAM-related security events.

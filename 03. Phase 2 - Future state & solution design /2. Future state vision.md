# Future State Vision
## 1. Purpose

The Future State Vision defines the target Identity and Access Management (IAM) ecosystem the organization aims to achieve as part of its modernization and cloud transformation strategy. It provides a strategic direction aligned with:

- Zero Trust security principles
- Regulatory requirements (GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001)
- Operational efficiency and automation objectives
- Business needs across IT, Security, HR, and Operational Technology (OT)

As IAM Business Analyst, I led this activity by consolidating inputs from key stakeholders (CISO, HR, IT Operations, OT teams, IAM architects) to ensure that the vision reflects a holistic, cross-functional view of organizational priorities.

This Future State Vision sets the foundation for:

- Target architecture design
- Solution evaluation and selection
- Governance and operating model definition
- Migration roadmap
- Change management planning

##  2. Strategic Principles
### 2.1 Zero Trust Security

- Enforce least privilege and continuous verification using Conditional Access.
- Transition to passwordless and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for workforce, partners, contractors, and privileged identities.
- Implement risk-based and context-aware access policies across hybrid IT/OT environments.

### 2.2 Unified IAM Ecosystem

- Migrate from legacy IAM to Microsoft Entra ID + Entra ID Governance.
- Ensure seamless federation and SSO across cloud, on-premises, and OT systems.
- Consolidate identity sources and eliminate fragmented directories.

### 2.3 Automation & workforce efficiency 

- Automate Joiner/Mover/Leaver workflows, including non-human identities (service accounts, API identities).
- Integrate IAM with HR systems, ServiceNow, SIEM, and SCADA/OT environments.
- Reduce onboarding delays and eliminate orphan accounts through synchronicity and policy-driven automation.

### 2.4 Governance, risk & compliance 

- Establish an IAM Center of Excellence (CoE) to centralize governance.
- Implement structured access reviews aligned with GDPR and NIS2.
- Define SLAs for provisioning, de-provisioning, access reviews, and incident response.

### 2.5 Stakeholder engagement & change management 

- Deploy a structured adoption strategy with training, communication, and transparent role definition.
- Implement a Shared Responsibility Model across security, HR, IT Ops, and OT.
- Support cultural adoption of IAM modernization with clear and consistent messaging.

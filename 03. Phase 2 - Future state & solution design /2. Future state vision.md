# Future State Vision
## 1. Purpose

The Future State Vision defines the target Identity and Access Management (IAM) ecosystem the organization aims to achieve as part of its modernization and cloud transformation strategy. It provides a strategic direction aligned with:

- Zero Trust security principles
- Regulatory requirements (GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001)
- Operational efficiency and automation objectives
- Business needs across IT, Security, HR, and Operational Technology (OT)

As IAM Business Analyst, I led this activity by consolidating inputs from key stakeholders (CISO, HR, IT Operations, OT teams, IAM architects) to ensure that the vision reflects a holistic, cross-functional view of organizational priorities.

This Future State Vision sets the foundation for:

- Target architecture design
- Solution evaluation and selection
- Governance and operating model definition
- Migration roadmap
- Change management planning

# 1. Governance meeting - Design phase kickoff 

## Purpose of the Meeting 
The primary objective of this meeting is to initiate the Design Phase of the IAM transformation project.
Key goals include:

- Aligning all stakeholders on the Future State Vision and target IAM architecture.
- Validating assumptions, constraints, and design principles.
- Discussing preliminary solution options and integration considerations for Workday, MS Entra ID, Entra ID Governance
- Active Directory, and Sentinel.
- Ensuring a shared understanding of responsibilities, governance, and compliance requirements before detailed technical design begins.

This meeting sets the foundation for solution design, technical specifications, and governance alignment.

## Key discussion points 

- Validation of Zero Trust-based design principles: least privilege, MFA, continuous verification.
- Agreement on integration strategy between Workday, Entra ID, Entra ID Governance, AD, and Sentinel.
- Confirmation of automation goals for identity lifecycle (joiner, mover, leaver) and access reviews.
- Review of regulatory and compliance alignment with GDPR, NIS2, and ISO27001.
- Discussion of governance structure, RACI roles, and responsibilities for the design phase.
- Identification of technical dependencies and risks, such as hybrid environment constraints or data synchronization challenges.

## Next steps 

- Prepare detailed technical design specifications based on agreed principles.
- Finalize integration workflows and lifecycle automation processes.
- Conduct compliance mapping for all critical systems.
- Schedule follow-up workshops for solution option validation and stakeholder approvals.
- Document RACI and governance decisions for design phase tracking and phase closure.

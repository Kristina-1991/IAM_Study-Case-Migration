4. Governance model & decision-making process
5. Design deliverables & acceptance criteria
6. Planning & milestones for the Design phase
7. Risks, constraints & assumptions recap
8. Dependencies & required inputs
9. Next steps & RACI confirmation

### Deliverables expected for design phase 

- High-level target architecture
- Detailed process workflows (AS-IS / TO-BE)
- Business requirements matrix
- Gap analysis
- Data model / access model definitions
- Integration mapping & technical dependencies
- Risk analysis & mitigation plan
- Updated backlog for Build phase
- Validation deck for Design phase closure

### Governance model 

| Governance Level              | Role                                 | Scope of Responsibility                                              |

| **Steering Committee**        | Sponsor, PM, Business Owner          | Strategic decisions, scope approval, budget & risks                  |
| **Design Authority Board**    | Architect, Security Lead, Tech Leads | Validate design choices, architecture consistency, compliance checks |
| **Operational Working Group** | BA, PO, Tech Teams                   | Requirements clarification, workflow design, technical feasibility   |


### Decision-making rules 

- Change requests follow formal approval (impact on scope, timeline, budget).
- Design decisions require validation by the Design Authority Board.
- Any blocker >5 working days escalates to Project Manager, then to Steering Committee if needed.

### Kickoff output 

- Governance agreed & validated
- Timeline and expectations confirmed
- Roles and responsibilities clarified

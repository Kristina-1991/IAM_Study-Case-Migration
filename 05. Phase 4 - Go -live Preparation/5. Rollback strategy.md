# 5. Rollback Strategy

## Objective
Ensure the ability to revert safely and quickly in case Go-Live introduces critical failures.

## Rollback Triggers
- Critical authentication failures  
- Provisioning disruptions affecting payroll or operational processes  
- SSO outages impacting core business tools  
- Data corruption or inconsistent identity states  

## Rollback Steps
1. Disable newly deployed policies  
2. Revert provisioning connectors to previous state  
3. Restore backup configurations  
4. Repoint SSO endpoints to legacy IAM if applicable  
5. Notify business escalation teams  

## Rollback Validation
- Confirm authentication recovery  
- Validate provisioning queues  
- Validate user access to priority applications  

## Deliverables
- Rollback checklist  
- Communication plan  
- Decision tree

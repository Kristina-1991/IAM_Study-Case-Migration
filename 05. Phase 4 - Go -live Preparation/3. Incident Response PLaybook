# 3. Incident Response Playbook (IAM-Specific)

## Objective
Provide a structured response plan for IAM-related incidents during and after Go-Live.

## Incident Categories
1. Authentication failures (e.g., CA policy misconfiguration)  
2. Provisioning errors (HRIS → Entra → AD → apps)  
3. SSO failures (SAML/OIDC/OAuth)  
4. Role/entitlement assignment issues  
5. Access governance workflow errors  

## Response Workflow
1. **Detection**  
   - Sentinel alerts  
   - Admin center notifications  
   - User reports  

2. **Classification**  
   - Severity (Critical/Major/Minor)  
   - Business impact  
   - Scope of affected systems  

3. **Containment**  
   - Disable faulty policies  
   - Pause provisioning connectors  
   - Switch authentication fallbacks  

4. **Resolution**  
   - Apply fix (policy, mapping, connector, application config)  
   - Retest and validate  

5. **Communication**  
   - Notify stakeholders and business owners  
   - Provide status updates  

6. **Post-Incident Review**  
   - Lessons learned  
   - Update runbooks  

## Deliverables
- Incident matrix  
- Severity scale  
- Predefined remediation actions

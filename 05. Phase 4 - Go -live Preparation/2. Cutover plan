# 2. Cutover Plan

## Objective
Define step-by-step activities required to transition from the current IAM environment to the new Entra ID–based solution.

## Scope
- System freeze requirements  
- Execution timeline (T-48h to T+24h)  
- Communication waves  
- Tasks for IAM, Infrastructure, Security, and Application teams  

## Cutover Steps (Example)
### Before Go-Live (T-48h to T-1h)
- Freeze identity-related changes  
- Validate synchronization with HRIS and AD  
- Backup policies, configuration, and access packages  
- Pre-deployment checks  

### Go-Live Execution (T0)
- Deploy Entra ID configuration  
- Activate provisioning jobs and access governance workflows  
- Switch SSO endpoints if applicable  
- Enable Conditional Access policies  

### Post Go-Live (T+1h to T+24h)
- Validate provisioning events  
- Confirm access for pilot users  
- Monitor authentication success/failure  
- Communicate status updates to stakeholders  

## Deliverables
- Cutover timeline  
- Responsible RACI per task  
- Communication template  
- Completion checklist

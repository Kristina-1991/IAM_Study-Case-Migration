# 4. Risk Register & Mitigation Plan

## Objective
Identify, track, and mitigate risks related to Go-Live, ensuring no critical blockers impact deployment.

## Risk Categories
- Technical risks (integration, configuration, performance)  
- Data-related risks (quality, reconciliation, attribute mapping)  
- Organizational risks (training gaps, support readiness)  
- Security risks (policy conflicts, MFA lockouts)  

## Risk Register Template
| Risk ID | Description | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|--------|
| R-01 | Authentication lockouts due to CA misconfig | High | Medium | Pre-Go-Live policy testing | IAM | Open |
| R-02 | HRIS attribute mismatches | Medium | High | Data validation scripts | HRIS | Mitigated |

## Mitigation Strategy
- Preventive validation  
- Monitoring readiness  
- Redundant support coverage  
- Predefined rollback triggers  

## Deliverables
- Risk register (master file)  
- Weekly risk review report
